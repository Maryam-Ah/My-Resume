# My-Resume

Maryam Ahmadi

Data Scientist | Machine Learning Engineer | Software Engineer
PROFILE: Data Scientist with +4 years of programming experience in Python, C#, Java, SQL and end-to-end Machine Learning techniques to build large-scale data, algorithms, and analytics applications and deploy the model with could platforms such as Azure ML, Heroku and Streamlit.

PROJECTS
Smart City
I created a model that predicts the number of vacancies for shelters in the city of Toronto. I had to extract, and wrangle data from various sources/formats, and clean it, do feature engineering, and data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. I applied different regression techniques such as LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, LinearSVR, VotingRegressor, Ridge, Lasso and NN and finally built a back-end of the web application using Flask Framework and deployed it on Heroku. 
My model has been used in the Region of Peel.

Build and deploy machine learning web app using Azure, Streamlit and Heroku  
I built a web application that supports online (one-by-one) prediction using a trained machine learning model and pipeline. This project contains three steps:
Train, validate and develop a machine learning pipeline using Azure ml.
Build a front-end web application with the functionality of online prediction with the Streamlit open-source framework.
Deploy the web app on Azure and Heroku. Once deployed, it will become publicly available and can be accessed via Web URL.
